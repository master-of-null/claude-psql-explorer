query: Please generate a SQL query that will show me the following information:

List all tables in the catalog schema
For each table, include:

The table name
The total number of columns
The number of foreign key relationships
The number of records (rows) in the table

Order the results by the number of records in descending order, so I can see the largest tables first.
